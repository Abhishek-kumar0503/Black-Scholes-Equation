# Black-Scholes-Equation
The Black-Scholes partial differential equation, found that it is very useful in financial engineering. We have obtained call option values of an underlying asset by Black-Scholes Equation, and observed that the call option price can be changed if we vary the parameters such as Stock price, Strike price, Expiration date, Risk-free rate etc.

Verify the Black-Scholes equations by using Taylor's theorem and Ito's theorem
